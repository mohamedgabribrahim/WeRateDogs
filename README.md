# WeRateDogs
Wrangle and data analysis project
 Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program
 
**WeRateDogs** Twitter account was used to create some analyses, insights, and visualizations.


## Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.


## Libraries
- The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip. 
    
    -   pandas
    -   NumPy
    -   requests
    -   tweepy
    -   json


## Project details
Data was gathered and added to the three following datasets
- twitter-archive-enhanced.csv
- tweet-json.txt
- image-predictions.tsv

**twitter_archive_master.csv** is a Jupyter Notebook that was created after gathering, assessing, cleaning, tyding, and merging the three datasets mentioned above together.
